Hi, Iâ€™m James ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a software engineer currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm currently a software engineer at Observe working on the compiler team! I'm also a 2023-24 Codepoint Fellow at Sutter Hill Ventures. In a previous life, I was an (under)graduate TA at the University of Michigan where I taught operating systems and intro to programming. When Iâ€™m not at work, you can catch me cooking/baking, hanging out with friends, and enjoying life in general!
