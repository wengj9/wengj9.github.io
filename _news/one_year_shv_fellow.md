It's been slightly more than a year since I started as a Codepoint Fellow at Sutter Hill Ventures. Overall, I really enjoyed my time working at both Luminary and Observe - super interesting to see how two startups work as part of the first cohort of the fellowship. After the two rotations, I'm heading back to Observe to start as a full-timer!
