I've migrated my personal website to another Jekyll template, [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) from [online-cv](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv). However, this came with some difficulties since `al-folio` is meant to be used with GitHub Actions deploying to GitHub Pages and I'm using Cloudflare Pages - weird things like the dark mode flickering occurred and I ended up nuking the site and using [this guide](https://www.mmcinnestaylor.com/blog/2024/al-folio-cloudflare/) from Marlan McInnes-Taylor to help deploy it!
