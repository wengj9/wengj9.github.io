_Note: If you're in the interview process for Codepoint, feel free to reach out to me! I'm always happy to chat with candidates_

It's been more than a year since my time as a Codepoint Fellow ended so this blog post is long overdue. I won't divulge too much about the program here since Chelsea would kill me otherwise.

## So, what is Codepoint anyway?

Codepoint is a program run by Sutter Hill Ventures where recent college grads do two rotations at various companies they've backed. Some companies include: [Observe](https://observeinc.com), [Sigma Computing](https://www.sigmacomputing.com), [Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com), and others. The rotations are six months each - in my opinion, you get a better feeling of what companies are like this way compared to your usual 12-week internship.

## Would I do it again?

Definitely yes! I didn't consider startups as a viable path when I was a master's student - now I'm working full-time at one ðŸ˜€
