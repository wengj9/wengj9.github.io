It's been about a year since I last updated the website and in the meantime, I've gotten less and less interested how it works. For some background, it's the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme on Jekyll which means it's quite easy to setup and get working. However, it feels quite limiting in how well it works due to my lack of knowledge of Ruby and Liquid templating. Additionally, I felt more confident after doing frontend work at Observe to work on a static blog in a more webdev-esque way.

Enter Astro! It's a static site generator built with JSX, so working on it looks like your average React site. I'm using the great AstroPaper theme with it and I'm already pretty happy with how nice it is to work with. I'm also hoping this sparks a small interest in writing more. Time will tell if that's the case...
